Pittsburgh in 2031 becomes the fourth autonomous zone to have been taken by the Black liberation movement.
Black student Mandy Landas & white student Tom Marden are studying on the new soundproof floor of the Floyd (formerly Hillman) Library 
when "sonic disturbances" suddenly kill hundreds of thousands of Pittsburghers. Tom calls 911 in hopes of receiving U.S. aid, and a soldier 
quickly arrives to their position. The soundscape ends as the soldier charges his sonic weapon to kill Tom and Mandy.
