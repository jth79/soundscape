My soundscape project is Sonic Conquest.

Pittsburgh in 2031 becomes the fourth autonomous zone to have been taken by the Black liberation movement.
Black student Mandy Landas & white student Tom Marden are studying on the new soundproof floor of the 
Floyd (formerly Hillman) Library when "sonic disturbances" suddenly kill hundreds of thousands of Pittsburghers.
They are absolutely terrified, but Tom is relieved to see that the United States government is
sending recovery teams into the autonomous zone. 

Mandy is concerned that the U.S. government will retaliate against them because of 
a recent executive order declaring that all voluntary autonomous zone occupants are aiding and 
abetting terrorism. Tom nevertheless calls 911 and shares their location. The operator says that a 
recovery team is already in the building and en route to their position. Almost instantaneously, a U.S. 
soldier kicks down the door and Tom cheers. 

This soldier with bulky military headphones and some odd 
handheld device calls into his radio to confirm that he will leave no survivors, 
but Tom is confused. Both Tom and Mandy are right there and doing just fine. 
A shrill sound builds, getting louder and louder. Tom yells confusedly. 
He then soberly asks Mandy what is happening. Mandy sighs. "They're not here to save us, Tom."Â 

The now fully charged handheld sonic weapon fires.
