My soundscape narrative "Sonic Conquest" is set in near-future (2031) Pittsburgh shortly after
it becomes the fourth autonomous zone to be taken by the Black liberation movement.
The audio follows two students studying on the highest floor of the Floyd (formerly Hillman) Library
when "sonic disturbances" suddenly and immediately kill hundreds of thousands of people in the city.
Safe at their current elevation, Tom and Mandy are terrified to hear the news,
but Tom is relieved to see that the U.S. is sending recovery teams to people who call 911.
Mandy is skeptical of what will happen to them after the most recent executive order declared
all voluntary autonomous zone occupants to be aiding and abetting terrorism. 
Tom calls 911, and the operator says that a recovery team is already in the building and en route to their position. 
Almost instantaneously, a U.S. soldier kicks down the door and Tom cheers. 
This soldier with bulky military headphones and some odd handheld device calls into his radio
to confirm that he will leave no survivors, but Tom is confused. Both Tom and Mandy are right there and doing just fine. 
As a shrill sound builds and Tom yells confusedly, Mandy sighs. "They're not here to save us, Tom." 
The now fully charged handheld sonic weapon (a much smaller form of what they used to 
murder most of the city inhabitants) kills them.
